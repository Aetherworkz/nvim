# Forewarning
This neovim config is not geared towards being the most optimized and feature-rich setup that I can make it. My goal here is to set things up as I get more comfortable with vim and update the config less and less over time.

## Dependencies
This configuration expects that you have lazygit installed. If not, or you decide upon some alternative, modify/remove the git row in `snacks.lua`
